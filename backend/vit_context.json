A student is declared to have passed a course if they secure a minimum of 40% in the theory FAT, 50% in the laboratory/project components, and 50% in the grand total marks for the course. Grades are awarded based on absolute or relative grading, depending on the course type and class strength."
      },
      {
          "question": "What is the difference between absolute and relative grading?",
          "answer": "Absolute grading is based on fixed mark ranges (e.g., S for >= 90, A for >= 80 but < 90, etc.), while relative grading is based on the student's performance relative to their peers in the same class. Relative grading is used for theory courses with a class strength of more than 10, while absolute grading is used for laboratory, soft skills, and project courses."
